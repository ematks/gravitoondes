* @section environment_conda Conda environment 
*
* For this project, it is assumed that the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment is installed on your machine.
* You can also refer to the [NPAC computing course](https://ens.lal.in2p3.fr/NPAC/env_initialisation.html#execution-environment) to install and setup a proper environment.
*
* Create a new environment to install the software needed for this project:
* ```
conda create -c conda-forge --name npac_project root python=3.8
* ```
* Activate this environment to develop your project:
* ```
conda activate npac_project
* ```
* To deactivate this environment, use:
* ```
conda deactivate
* ```
*
* @section environment_git Git / GitLab
*
* Your computer project will be managed using git.
*
* @subsection environment_git_repo Git repository
*
* The original project should be cloned to your local computer:
* ```
git clone https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/npac/gravitational-waves.git
* ```
* This repository must be redefined as the `upstream` project:
* ```
cd gravitational-waves/
git remote rename origin upstream
* ```
* Go to [gitlab](https://gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr) and create a new project named `gravitational-waves`.
* @note PLEASE, invite Florent Robinet as a member of your project: go to "members" and add Florent Robinet as a "developer"
*
* Add the `origin` remote to your local repository:
* ```
git remote add origin git@gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr:robinet/gravitational-waves.git
* ```
* @note Change `robinet` by your username.
* @note This command assumes that a ssh key is in place.
*
* Now you should see 2 remote repositories:
* ```
git remote -v
origin	git@gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr:robinet/gravitational-waves.git (fetch)
origin	git@gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr:robinet/gravitational-waves.git (push)
upstream	https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/npac/gravitational-waves.git (fetch)
upstream	https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/npac/gravitational-waves.git (push)
* ```
* Your local branch must be associated to your origin:
* ```
git push --set-upstream origin master
* ```
* Finally push the changes to your remote repo using:
* ```
git push origin master
* ```
* Now, your project is in place in gitlab. You can check it at https://gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr/robinet/gravitational-waves.
* @warning For this project, 2 students will share the same remote repository.
* Therefore the creation of the remote gitlab project should only be done once, by one of the student.
* The second student should be added to the project as a "developer" and simply clone the origin:
* ```
git clone git@gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr:robinet/gravitational-waves.git
* ```
*
* @subsection environment_git_worflow Git workflow
*
* @subsubsection environment_git_worflow_commit Commit your changes
*
* When you develop your code, you should frequently commit and push your changes to your remote repository (`origin`):
* ```
# commit your changes to your local repository:
git commit -a

# push your changes to your origin repository:
git push origin
* ```
* Your remote repository will be used to control and evaluate your work.
* 
* @subsubsection environment_git_worflow_pull Synchronize your work with your partner
*
* The project will be developed by 2 persons.
* When the first person pushes some changes, the second person must update its local repository: 
* ```
git pull
* ```
* When doing this, there can be conflicts if a file was edited by both developers.
* You will have to fix the conflicts and commit your changes.
* 
* @subsubsection environment_git_worflow_add Add new files
*
* If you want to add a new file to your repository:
* ```
git add [new file]
git commit [new file]
* ```
*
* @subsubsection environment_git_worflow_upstream Synchronize with upstream
*
* When the original repository is updated (by F. Robinet), you may want to update your repository to synchronize the changes:
* ```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master origin/master
git push origin
* ```
*
* @section environment_doc Documentation
*
* When you push your changes to the remote repository, a documentation is automatically built.
* Public web pages are posted online:
*
* [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) is used to generate the documentation.
* Your code should be properly documented.
* Refer to the existing code to see how it works.
